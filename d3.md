## scales

scales use the identity relationship as default, but are modified when we input a domain and a range. 
domain() and range() method set the values for the scale.

Domain - input. Mapped along the x axis. 
Range - output. Mapped along the y axis. 

We should always be setting the scale so that the visualization fits inside the SVG container's width and height.
